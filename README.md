### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am just a hobby developer playing around with different technologies.

My most interesting projects (and the majority of actual production projects) are not public projects.

Current list of my active projects:
- BI tool for my normal job
- Crawler tool for a streaming guide
- koblr.dk 
- React native app for work


Most projects are build with either ruby, ruby on rails, react or react native.
